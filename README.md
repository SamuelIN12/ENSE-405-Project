Project idea/background & business need/opportunity
Here, you should discuss information that will help the viewer (the instructor, your classmates, and the general public) understand the context and background history regarding your project idea (your "why" #simonsinek #goldencircle). This discussion should assume that viewers are not well-versed (knowledgeable) regarding the background of the project or project area. You should also try to dive into the business need (if any), problem, or opportunity/innovation that your team's project idea will solve/introduce into the world

Aim to build a website that creates a diet plan that is tailored to people with certain health issues, as it correlates with their medications. 

This website will be created to support the UN Goal 3, which is Good health and Well-being. 

3.4 By 2030, reduce by one-third premature mortality from non-communicable diseases through prevention and treatment and promote mental health and well-being.

3.8 Achieve universal health coverage, including financial risk protection, access to quality essential health-care services, and access to safe, effective, quality, and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all.

Reason
Before we start creating something, we need to know why we are creating it. We create for many reasons, such as:

To solve a problem (This is the engineer's bread and butter)
Show someone our thinking
Express our ideas, feelings, or interpretations
Interpret information in a new way
Etc.
So think about and discuss your team's reason to create?

Impact
Sometimes we can start with the impact we want to create - how will our project and the work we do on our project change our current reality, and how will we achieve this new reality, e.g. learning new tech, using class notes from Tim's classes...haha, etc.)? This helps us think more broadly while we are creating. To help discuss your project's impact, [fill in the details] and discuss the following statement in your vlog

When we are done [our current reality] will now be [our new reality] so we think we need to [action step]

Who
You will also "flesh" this information out in-process and associated documentation this term, but it's also good to reiterate it here (to either help you get started or help you iteratively refine things). When we know who we are creating for, our audience, our work is more meaningful, relevant, and appropriate. So think about and discuss:

Who is your audience?
Whose opinion matters?
Who do you want to reach with your work?
Also, know/discuss where your audience is?
In the same room, city, province, across the globe?
Where do they get their information? (paper, digital, opinion, peer-reviewed, etc.)
What
Think about and discuss what type of constraints your team envisions, e.g. knowledge, technology, access to customers, etc? Constraints are important to know as they enable us to push ourselves to think even more creatively To inspire better thinking, we have to become more resourceful and work within limitations - what are the envisioned constraints and limitations?

Project documentation
Along with providing documents in your GitHub, I would also like for you to post them here. I realize this is a duplication of efforts. However, it will help me mark and keep track of things

Scrum comments
Here's were Tim will put scrum comments and project check-in knowledge
