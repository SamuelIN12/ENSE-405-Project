# Project idea/background & business need/opportunity
Here, you should discuss information that will help the viewer (the instructor, your classmates, and the general public) understand the context and background history regarding your project idea (your "why" #simonsinek #goldencircle). This discussion should assume that viewers are not well-versed (knowledgeable) regarding the background of the project or project area. You should also try to dive into the business need (if any), problem, or opportunity/innovation that your team's project idea will solve/introduce into the world

Aim to build a website that creates a diet plan that is tailored to people with certain health issues, as it correlates with their medications. It will provide the necessary information needed for patients to navigate through healthy dieting and mental wellness. 


For this MVP, this project aims to be a tool for knowledge dissemination in the community, that patients can apply while navigating through healthy dieting and maintaining mental wellness

This website will be created to support UN Goal 3, which is Good health and Well-being. 
3.4 By 2030, reduce by one-third premature mortality from non-communicable diseases through prevention and treatment and promote mental health and well-being.

3.8 Achieve universal health coverage, including financial risk protection, access to quality essential healthcare services, and access to safe, effective, quality, and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all.


# Reason
There is currently no platform that houses a community of health experts that cater to patients living with specific health conditions and the stigma of it, by providing them with the right knowledge about dieting that is specific to their health condition.

This project is also giving me the opportunity to express my ideas and implement a solution that I feel is very necessary.


# Impact
When I am done our current reality of just having one space of healthy dieting and mental well-being will now be our new reality of a community of health experts coming together in the community to provide essential health services to those in need of it, by providing the right knowledge, and so I think I need to investigate technology inventory more, to know what is available and how it can be improved upon.


# Who
The audience for this application is mainly health experts(dieticians and therapist) and people with specific health conditions who need to live better and healthier
The opinion of the health experts matter, and that of the patients, as they are the ones who will be using the application.
I would love to reach health experts whose drive is to see to the good health and well-being of people, most especially those battling specific health conditions.
Also, know/discuss where your audience is?
My audience is those across the globe, considering this being an online application.
Information will be gotten online for the audience.
What
The major constraint that I envision is time. Time is needed to achieve the desirable features for this application. Considering the semester I am in, I have limited time, as my time is spread across other class projects and the capstone.
